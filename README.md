# 42 Piscine Test

## My solutions in the École 42 Piscine Test

This project is a bunch of basic C functions. We made them from scratch as part of a test at École 42. The idea was to learn more about how C works by creating these functions without using the usual code shortcuts.

The projects are pretty straightforward; only the Rush and BSQ tasks were a bit challenging. You might find it a bit difficult to understand them without the project PDFs.

For clarification, here's a breakdown of the Rush and BSQ tasks:

- **Rush00:** Print the square pattern.
- **Rush01:** Solve the skyscraper puzzle.
- **BSQ:** Find the biggest square in the map.

In conclusion, this test has advanced our hard skills in C programming, GIT, and Unix. We successfully tackled challenges such as rewriting standard C functions, including the complex Rush and BSQ tasks. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the projects at École 42 improved our teamwork and collaboration skills.
